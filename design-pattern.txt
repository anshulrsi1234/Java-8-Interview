Behaviour design Patern :

1) Strategy design pattern
2) Template design pattern: The Template Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class but allows subclasses to override specific steps of the algorithm                                  without changing its overall structure.

    Real Use Case Example: Online Payment Processing System

    Youâ€™re building an e-commerce platform that supports multiple payment gateways (e.g., PayPal, Stripe, Apple Pay). Each payment method has a slightly different implementation, but the overall flow is the same:

    1) Validate payment details
    2) Connect to payment gateway
    3) Make the transaction
    4) Send confirmation email

Benefits:

a) Code reuse: The process_payment() logic is reused.
b) Open/Closed Principle: You can add more processors (Apple Pay, Google Pay) without modifying existing code.
c) Clear structure: Makes the algorithm easier to follow and maintain.

// ========================= Stream API & Lambda Expression ===================================================

1) : What is Lambda expression : 

Ans : A Lambda expression (or function) is just an anonymous function, i.e., a function with no name and without being bounded to an identifier. 
They are written exactly in the place where it’s needed, typically as a parameter to some other function.

2) - Why do we need Lambda Expression?

Ans : We need to use Lambda Expressions due to following reasons:

	1) Reduced Lines of Code
	2) Sequential and Parallel Execution Support
	3) Passing Behaviors into methods
	4) Higher Efficiency with Laziness

3) What is Functional Interfaces and why do we need in java.

Ans : The java.util.function package in Java 8 has many built-in functional interfaces like. A significant example is the Runnable and Callable interfaces used in concurrency APIs

Built-in Functional Interfaces in Java : 

1)predicate	  = Retun true and false
2)Consumer	  = Take input as type but doesnot return any value.
3)Supplier	  = Take no input but trurn output.  Ex=  T get() /optional Class
4)Functional  = Take input and return value 

4) 
	a)What is Stream and Stream API. Why it was introduced in java 8 [To Support MultiCore uses]
	b)Fork/join is now the framework that’s used under the covers for parallel operations in the Streams API

5) Stream API function function or Method 

Ans : Below Are Function/Method.

	A) Terminal Operations : That produce a result or side effect, such as 
	
	toArray()
	collect()
	count()
	reduce()
	forEach()
	forEachOrdered()
	min()
	max()
	anyMatch()
	allMatch()
	noneMatch()
	findAny()
	findFirst()

	B) Non-Terminal Operations (Inter-Mediate-operation) : That transform a stream into another stream, such as

	filter()  ->  Filter out all the stream based on the condtion , Return true and false value
	map() 	  ->  create the new of type stream .
	flatMap() ->  Same as map but do the flattening ( Do the flattening means that combines all stream and produce the single result.)
	peek()	  ->  Just for Debugging purpose, print the stream
	reduce()  ->  For Aggreagate function like Addition,subtraction , multiplication
	distinct  ->  Always return disctinct stream element
	limit()   ->  Return mention element of stream
	Sort      ->  Sort the Stream Element based on the condition.
	Collector ->  Convert the element back to the collection

===========================================  My First Jourmey by Air (Day 2)==============================================================================
 
Since my childhood i was crazy about the travelling and I want to fly in the plane. I got this opportunity around 2011 when i was in delhi. I came to know that my office is planning a trip to Goa and those employee want to go there can nominate their name. I had nominated for the same. Once my nomination has been confirm by team, i started to packed my bag and take camera  and  many more things which is required for this trip. 

Before that i had never been at airport so my friend and i took a cab and we together go there. Once I reached at there i saw a huge plane was going to land. After seen this movement i was very happy. We show our identity at the gate and then go inside. I had completed formalities like take boarding pass and handover the  luggage to him. For 1 hour's we were in waiting room and taking rest in airport premises , then i saw a a huge plane was standing out . For the first time i have seen a plane of this size . Since my childhood i used to think the planes are smaller but didn't expect this much of size after saw the real plane.

My flight time was 2 PM. Around 1:45 PM all passengers move toward plane. A bus is was there to take all passenger, Once all passengers sit there then bus start moving toward plane. Once we reached the place where plane was standing then I had click so many photos. 

After reaching in the plane,I got my seat. It was a very econoomic class and there is no enough space but I was lucky to get window seat and it was near pane engine. Now i was exacited about the journey. At 2 PM my plane was ready to takeoff and within couple of minute i was in air.

During my whole journey I saw a blue sky and also white cloud in the blue sky. 

After 2 hrs of Journey , i feelt heavy pressure . Around 5 PM  we landed there. so it was a great exprience of my life because my childhood wishes had been completed.

 ====================  My First Salary. =============================================

After I completed engineering i wanted to be self-independent and I was looking for a good job . I got this oppourtunity after 4 months when I got the interview call from a company and i had cleared the interview with them. Once my selection had been confirmed, I joined that company which was situated in Delhi. Me and my family were very happy. Those days no metro's were available in Delhi, so you had to travel in blue line bus. Traveling in these buses was very risky and time consuming. Some time they just stopped the bus anywhere . Due to this behaviour, some time people got frustrated . My office time was 9 to 6. Everyday i got up at 6 AM and start preparing for the office.
After completing month over there , they handedover to me the salary cheque, but at that time I didn't have any bank account so I kept it at house. As it was my first earning after collage , therefore i was very happy and it was a memorable moment for me. I handover this cheque to my parents but they returend it to me and said this is your earning/salray so you have to keep it. They gave me a blessing. But once my bank account opened , I deposited the cheque there. After some time i withdrew some amount and purchased some clothes. So I would say it was a memorable experience for me.

 ====================  My First Salary. =============================================

After I completed engineering i wanted to be self-independent and I was looking for a good job . I got this oppourtunity after 4 months when I got the interview call from a company and i had cleared the interview with them. Once my selection had been confirmed, I joined that company which was situated in Delhi. Me and my family were very happy. Those days no metro's were available in Delhi, so you had to travel in blue line bus. Traveling in these buses was very risky and time consuming. Some time they just stopped the bus anywhere . Due to this behaviour, some time people got frustrated . My office time was 9 to 6. Everyday i got up at 6 AM and start preparing for the office.
After completing month over there , they handedover to me the salary cheque, but at that time I didn't have any bank account so I kept it at house. As it was my first earning after collage , therefore i was very happy and it was a memorable moment for me. I handover this cheque to my parents but they returend it to me and said this is your earning/salray so you have to keep it. They gave me a blessing. But once my bank account opened , I deposited the cheque there. After some time i withdrew some amount and purchased some clothes. So I would say it was a memorable experience for me.


=================================== The gadget have repair yourself =================================================================================

This is from last year, when my mobile fell down from my pocket. After some time I felt that my mobile wifi was not working . That time I had only one phone so I want the soltion of this problem ASAP. Due to this incidence, I was unable to picked any call as well as unable to send any meesage on whatsapp and also i was unable to paid payment via paytm . I was worried about that because it was the lockdown time and no shops were opened those days, so it was a tough situation for me.
I started , to findout the solution of this problem on youtube and found that mobile wifi-chip got damaged. So I had ordered the new wifi chip from Amazon . Within 2 days they delivered  the same. 
I had searched the few videos on youtube and started to repair the gadget.Before that I had never repaired any mobile. Well, I followed the procedure step by step described on youtube , first time i failed to change the wifi-chip. Next days I tried again and after 1 hour of hard work, I replaced the faulty wifi chip . I was very happy because without going to shop , i had replaced the faulty wifi part. From that days to till now , my mobile is working fine and no issue is coming.


================================================ The your First Mobile ======================================================================================

Around 2013 I had purchased my first mobile when I was studying in graduation . It was of micromax company . I was very happy because it was my first mobile phone which had doblie SIM slot and that time Micromax was only company that solding double SIM phone. Its cost was not high so at this amount micromax was the best deal.
My family had purchased our first phone aound 2003 when BSNL started the mobile service in our city and those days we had purchased NOKIA 3100 phone.
It was a heavey phone but best advantage was that when it was fell down it will not be breake. To have a mobile is always makes you happy even today if you dont have mobile you feels vey sad. 

=================================== Should uniform be allowed in school ? =================================================================================

In my opinion uniform should be allowed in school because if we doesn't allow uniform, then many rich students can come in school in expensive clothes, but what about other students, those are not rich, and they can't buy very expensive uniform . Due to this problem, some students who are no rich, they feel uncomfortable and othe . In my opinion school is a place where you go to get learning; schools are not a fashion industry.
If every one wears a school uniform then it looks like everyone is equal and they don't feel uncomfortable. For Example, In Big schools, Now-a-days many rich students come via an expensive car, bike and school and due to this those students are not rich, they feel uncomfortable.
So in my opinion school dress should be allowed.

Thanks you so much for providing me an oppourtunty to describe about the topic which is 'day spend with friend'. 

I m a lucky person to have multiple friends , but one of them is my best friend. His name is Rahul.  I liked his nature as he  is soft spoken . He is really cool guy. He has the ability to lafed other person.  He advice me  from time to time. His Advic is always helpful to me to grow myself in case personal or profeesional.
 
We both goes to sport complex and play the racket together. He is not ploitically motivaive guy he helped many time like while driving a car. He suggest me to go to the training school to learn how to drive a car. He is a quick learner and does not biterate me till now. His hobby is reading the book (noval). 

Everytime when i feels boar at my home , i always goes there because he can make peopple laugh that is his quality.

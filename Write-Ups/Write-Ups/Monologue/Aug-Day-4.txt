====================================  A law you would like to changed in your country (Day 4) =================================================================

Thanks you so much for providing me an oppoutunty to speak about the topc which is 'A law you would like to change in our country'. In our country we have multiple laws but one special law I would like to changed which is releated to cast based reservation. Now a days every part of society want reservation , even though they are not capable and also they are finacial strong in spite of that they want reservation . Due to this 'very talent people' are not coming to our systems and those who are not capable now becoming part of our sytems. And these incapable people are managing our country as these people does not have the capabilty to implement a new idea's/rule in our country due to this our country lag behind like other small countries progressing. 
In most of the goverment company, these people got job very easily  due to this cast based reservation . Therefore if i got the chance to ammend/modified the law , then i would recommand/suggest it should be based on the financial condition , those people who are finacial weak they should get the scholarship or some rewards also . This process will create a positive envirement in our country and nobody will complained about it.
2) Secound law that i would like to change is releated to transport/Driving. While driving , I have seen many people drive a car very unproffessionally , they dont follow traffic rule and they changed their lane very quickly,  due to this chances of accident is very high.Some people drinked during driving therefore it create a problem for all other vechle on the road , due to this sometime accident happended and After that their family will bear the cost . In my opion during routine patroling those people found drunk or talking on mobile , their drivig licence should be revoked and up to 2 year they should not allowed to drive. And while driving some people continsly talk on mobile so sometime they loose their concentration the chances of accident may higher. so it should be punishable.

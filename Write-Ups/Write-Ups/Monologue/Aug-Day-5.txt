====================================  My first day experience in collage (Day 5) =========================================================================

Thanks you so much for providing me an opportunity where i can express/write my thoughts on the topic which is my first day experience in collage.
After finished my 12 board exam ,I want to go in engg collage. I had taken the admission in nearest Engg collage which was 2 KM far from my home. I was very happy when i came to know that i got the admission in the collage.
On First day my collage had finished all formalities and assigned a class as per my skill. On First day it was a induction session where we had speak about ourselves like from where you belongs , your hobby and many things etc. On that day after collage hours , our senior takes our ragging. On second day I had joined the computer class , before that I was not aware about any computer/computer language. My computer teacher told us about computer but I didn't get/understand any single word, I was shocked that we could not understand a single word. My collage director was very hard/strict, he didn't give us more leave. But overall my collage was very good, As it was in my home town so it had save my money if i was out of house.
During My collage time I had face many challenges regarding language problem and communication problem etc. Even though I had finished my engineering with good number.

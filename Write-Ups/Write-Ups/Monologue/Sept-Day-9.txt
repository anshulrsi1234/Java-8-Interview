==============================================  Your Favorite Animal ================================================================

1) My favourite animal is Dog. Because Dog is the smart animal and he can understand the feeling and behaviour of Human so whenever we give him any order he act accoring to our instruction. Dog protect us Day/night and when any strange people try to infiltrate in our house OR in our socaeity,  he bark to him and alert us. Whenever we had to gone outside the city , we always concious about our home safety but if we have dog,then we will feels secure. 
 
2) Now a days , Miltary use dogs to complete his many task like search any landmine,as machine are costly and sometime it fail to found any suspious item so we prefered dog always because dog give us good result and always find landmine very quickly due to his quality , he prevent the losses of human life .  

3) Todays all our force used dog at evry place whether it is airport or railways station, where dog used to search any unwanted item, things or person. In Case  in any crisis(nautrual disaster) we used dog to search people if they are in danger.
In 24 century , some country providing the traing so that they can kill the milantant and protect our solder . In jammu & kashmir our force using dog to prevent any damage to our solder. During parrotling if he found any suspecious item , people he alert our solder.

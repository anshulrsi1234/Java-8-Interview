====================================== Activity you did this weakend =================================================================
Thank you so much for providing me an oppourntunity to write about the activity you did this weakend.
Last weekend was very hectic for me,i m was travlling to my hometown. On saturday i wokeup at 3 AM, then pack my begs and let the city aroung 4AM.  I had reached the house around 8 AM after 4 Hours of journey/driving. After reaching my house i take rest and then sleep.
Then i had revised my last session you taught to me and found that now i m able to graph some word pronounciation . After Reading i did some cleaning of our room .
I had done some shopping for family as well as for myself. On sunday i had done some cleaning and wash cloths.
So these are the activity i did this in this weakend.

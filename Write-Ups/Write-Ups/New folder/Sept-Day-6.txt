=================================== your unforgetten moment = My first trip by Plane to Goa.

I did not forget my first air trip to Goa. Since my childhood i wanted to fly in the plane and wanted to visit Goa as well. I got this oppourtunity in 2011, when i came to know that my office is planning a trip to goa. I got the email form my team and i had applied for the same. Once my trip had been confirmed by travel team, I started to pack my beg and take nesseray things, like camera,  cloth etc.

Before that I had never been at airport , So my friend and I both take cab from our house and started the trip. Once I reached at the airport i was very happy because first time in my life i saw many big planes there. We had completed our entry informalities and went inside the airport. It was a very big place and big glass were there so that you can saw outside seen.  I had taken many photo and started toward counter for ticket collection and for luggaege handover and I did the same within 10 min. 

Then we moved toward the waiting area and we had wait there till 1 hours.  Once boarding started, we moved toward to plane . A bus was there to carry you and safely reached/ you near the plane . Once we reached there , First time i had saw  I hug plane. I had gone inside and got my seat . It was economy class and did not have enough space but i  was lucky to got the wondow seat.
